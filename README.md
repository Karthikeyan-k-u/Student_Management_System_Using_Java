# Student_Management_System_Using_Java
              **Description**
This program uses a class and constructor to store student details such as name, department, year, and academic year. It uses objects to create student records, methods to display student information, and a loop to handle multiple students. The Scanner class is used for user input, and string splitting is used to read comma-separated data. It demonstrates constructors, method calling, arrays, loops, and basic input/output in Java.

**Algorithm**
* Start the program.
* Read the number of students n.
* Repeat the following steps n times:
  - Read student details as a comma-separated string.
  - Split the string into name, department, year, and academic year.
  - Create a student object using the constructor.
  - Generate and display a student ID.
  - Display student details using class methods.
* Close the input stream.
* End the program.
